    <ul>
      <li>Watching movies and TV shows</li>
      <p>I will mention my top 3 characters in the history of TV:
        <ul>
           <li><strong><em>Dexter:</em></strong> <img src="./Images/Dexter.jpg" height="100"/></li><br>
            <p>
              To speak about dexter, I need an essayüòÖ. This is my number 1 character of all time.<br>
              This character touched me from inside my heart. and I was agreeing most of the time with him.<br>
              It's not perfect, but I liked how I felt that I shared some thoughts with it.
            </p>
           <li><strong><em>Walter White aka (heisenberg):</em></strong> <img src="./Images/walter.jpg" height="100"/></li><br>
            <p>
              This one, he is 100% perfect and pure as his work üòÅ(if you know what I mean!)<br>
              The way the story of walter white is told is simply perfect, I find him as a lesson and even the decisions he makes are all excused,<br>
              becasue he was right with every single thing he did even if it's bad.
            </p>
           <li><strong><em>House: </strong></em><img src="./Images/house.jpg" height="100"/></li>
            <p>
              Now, this man I consider him as a professor in life, he has his own thoughts and no one can understand them unless you were him<br>
              **All People Li** this sentence can summrize our life. we all do lie, but for the sake of something we need.<br>
            </p>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why do I enjoy watching TV?</h2>
    <p>First of all I consider my self adicited to these things,
      and I always when I watch this kind of shows I discover new things in my brain that didn't know about.<br>
      Maybe you'll say that I am crazy. But trust me, when you watch them you will find yourself interacting with their decisions.<br>
      You will agree on most of them and you will hate most of them, becasue from the prespective of view and the way the story is told, it will let you sympathized with them.
